# Angularjs testing examples

This project was generated with [yo angular modular generator](https://github.com/johannesjo/generator-modular-angular)
version 1.1.3 and tweaked a little bit by myself.

## Build & development

* `gulp start` for development
* `npm run build` for building
* `npm run start:dist` for serving the previously built code


## Testing

* `npm test`
